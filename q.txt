GO Rules for Beginners

This was made from go lessons from Yilun Yang with LLoyd Eric Cotsen. Any errors or omissions are solely mine.

Caveat: These rules are most useful in the begging and and early middle game.

Fundamental Rule of Go: Do you have a weak stone or stones? If yes, then help them otherwise move in a big area.

Tactics

Atari: Never atari unless you have a reason. If you can capture a stone or stones directly then do so. Directly means that you (not Alpha Go) can see how to capture something right away. If this is part of a joseki or forcing sequence that you should play now then do so. Otehrwise wait.

Push-Cut: Do not push if you are not going to cut right away.

Paying Money - Do not pay money unless you have to. (maybe not beginner?)

Avoid making and empty triangle. (and maybe eleohant eye?)

Ponuki: Never give your opponent a ponuki.

Cross Cut
Can you capture a stone directly? Directly means that you (not not Alpha Go) can see how to capture something right away.


Strategy

Confused - If you can not figure out what to do locally, consider tenuki (play elsewhere). If you are losing baddly in some area, consider tenuki.

Opponet makes a bad move: You almost always should punish this immediately, otherwise it may turn into a good move!

Tenuki
  1-1 - You may tenuki
  2-1 - Do not tenuki
  3-1 - You probably should tenuki (wait).
  4-1 (or more) - You must tenuki (wait).

Corner Joseki (for both sides)
    1. Get out.
    2. Take corner.
    3. Complete the shape.
